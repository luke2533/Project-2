# Hydra PC's - Project 2

Hydra PC’s is a computer hardware store with a focus for custom bespoke gaming PC’s where users can pick and choose parts for their personal needs. The project's goals are to deliver a streamlined storefront for users to build up a PC from case to storage with a part tracker and price tracker to accompany it updating after each part is selected in the form of a list. The user can then go to checkout to complete their order or save the computer's specs by saving it by sending an email to them with the list of parts they chose.

### 1.4 User stories

1.4.1 User is looking to custom build a PC
1.4.2 User wants a pre set built computer
1.4.3 User isn't sure what computer they need
1.4.4 User wants to save there custom PC specs
1.4.5 User wants to know the total price of their PC

1.4.1 The user wants to build a custom PC but doesn't want to buy each part from different sellers, the user can find the custom PC maker on any page through the footer and nav-bar. Where they can go through each part and select a part to make their PC that fits their requirements.

1.4.2 The user doesn’t know enough about computers to build their own through the custom PC builder, users can find the pre-built PC’s under find your PC link on nav-bar and footer. Users can select a pre-built PC where the specs and price will display information on it.  

1.4.3 For users who know nothing about computers and need assistance in picking a computer, the Find Your PC can be found on all pages on the nav-bar or footer. The page has a drop down menu where a number of questions are asked for the user to find out what their requirements and restrictions are, then present the computers that they can afford.

1.4.4 After building a custom PC on the build PC page the user may not have the money or wants to build multiple computers but doesn't want to lose the PC when they load the computer. To avoid this the user can save the specs list and it will be sent to their email address.

1.4.5 The user is creating a custom computer but needs to stick within a budget and needs a way to track the costs, on the build PC page at the left side of the page a sidebar follows the user on the page as they scroll up and down. This adds the parts the user has selected and totals the cost of the hardware underneath the part section.
