# Hydra PC's - Project 2

Hydra PC’s is a computer hardware store with a focus for custom bespoke gaming PC’s where users can pick and choose parts for their personal needs. The project's goals are to deliver a streamlined storefront for users to build up a PC from case to storage with a part tracker and price tracker to accompany it updating after each part is selected in the form of a list.
