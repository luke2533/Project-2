# Hydra PC's - Project 2

Hydra PC’s is a computer hardware online store that sells both pre built PC’s and custom made gaming PC’s. The website's goals are to create a PC builder where users can pick and choose parts for their personal rig that displays the parts price and some basic information for the specs. The website will also feature pre-built PC’s for those who lack hardware knowledge, through a questionnaire that will help find what the user needs and find the computer best tailored to their wants and needs.

1.4.3 User isn't sure what computer they need
1.4.4 User wants to save there custom PC specs

1.4.1 The user wants to build a custom PC but doesn't want to buy each part from different sellers, the user can find the custom PC maker on any page through the footer and nav-bar. Where they can go through each part and select a part to make their PC that fits their requirements.

1.4.2 The user doesn’t know enough about computers to build their own through the custom PC builder, users can find the pre-built PC’s under find your PC link on nav-bar and footer. Users can select a pre-built PC where the specs and price will display information on it.  

1.4.3 For users who know nothing about computers and need assistance in picking a computer, the Find Your PC can be found on all pages on the nav-bar or footer. The page has a drop down menu where a number of questions are asked for the user to find out what their requirements and restrictions are, then present the computers that they can afford.

1.4.4 After building a custom PC on the build PC page the user may not have the money or wants to build multiple computers but doesn't want to lose the PC when they load the computer. To avoid this the user can save the specs list and it will be sent to their email address.

1.4.5 The user is creating a custom computer but needs to stick within a budget and needs a way to track the costs, on the build PC page at the left side of the page a sidebar follows the user on the page as they scroll up and down. This adds the parts the user has selected and totals the cost of the hardware underneath the part section.
